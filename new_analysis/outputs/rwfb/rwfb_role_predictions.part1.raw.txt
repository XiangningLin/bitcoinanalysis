To classify the roles of Bitcoin addresses, we'll analyze the node attributes such as in-degree, out-degree, total degree, and betweenness centrality. We will also consider the type of nodes they are connected to, which can provide insights into their roles. Here's a JSON list with the inferred roles for a few nodes:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s",
        "role": "centralized exchange hot wallet",
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "rationale": "High in-degree and out-degree with significant total degree and betweenness suggest frequent transaction flow typical of an exchange hot wallet."
    },
    {
        "id": "3EX34GnTCYKLrGb7q5nc2obCXwnApvm3kJ",
        "role": "merchant gateway",
        "confidence": 0.7,
        "rationale": "Moderate in-degree and out-degree with modest betweenness, indicating a role in facilitating transactions but not as a central hub."
    },
    {
        "id": "338xujMDjUVdYqdE1kg37FTFMEK2cWQAAp",
        "role": "retail user",
        "confidence": 0.6,
        "rationale": "Low in-degree and out-degree with low betweenness, suggesting limited transaction volume typical of a retail user."
    },
    {
        "id": "3Npnt1QMXeAjFa49eR3eDRAYDWBXTu7q7o",
        "role": "service aggregator",
        "confidence": 0.8,
        "rationale": "Low in-degree but high out-degree and connections to diverse nodes indicate a role in distributing transactions, typical of a service aggregator."
    },
    {
        "id": "32Mf4hkRXAxhrkY2EjrzVcX8diTPKVEfhA",
        "role": "exchange cold wallet",
        "confidence": 0.75,
        "rationale": "Higher in-degree than out-degree, low betweenness, and connections to hot wallets suggest storage rather than active transaction processing."
    }
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Centralized Exchange Hot Wallet**: High transaction throughput with both high in-degree and out-degree, and high betweenness indicating a central position in the transaction network.
- **Merchant Gateway**: Moderate transaction activity with balanced in-degree and out-degree, indicating facilitation of transactions.
- **Retail User**: Lower degrees and betweenness suggest personal or infrequent use.
- **Service Aggregator**: High out-degree with diverse connections, facilitating many outgoing transactions.
- **Exchange Cold Wallet**: High in-degree with lower out-degree, serving as a storage rather than a transactional role, typical of cold storage for exchanges.
