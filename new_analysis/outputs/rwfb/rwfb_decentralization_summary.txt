The sampled network data suggests a decentralized structure with multiple hubs rather than a single dominant hub. This is evident from the distribution of nodes with varying degrees, such as the node with the highest total degree of 385 and others with significantly lower degrees. The presence of multiple nodes with substantial but not overwhelmingly high degrees indicates multiple hubs within the network, promoting decentralization.

The network's robustness is supported by the distribution of betweenness centrality values, which are generally low, implying that no single node acts as a critical bridge. This suggests that the network can maintain connectivity even if some nodes are removed, enhancing its resilience.

Furthermore, the network exhibits small-world characteristics, with an average clustering coefficient indicating localized clustering and a relatively short path length between nodes. This combination supports efficient information dissemination, characteristic of small-world networks. Overall, the network's structure favors decentralization with multiple hubs, robust connectivity, and small-world properties.
