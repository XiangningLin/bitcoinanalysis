- **Exchange Consolidation:** The presence of numerous nodes with high in-degrees and few out-degrees suggests users may be consolidating their assets into a few exchanges, possibly indicating a trend towards fewer, larger platforms dominating the market.

- **Mixer Activity:** High betweenness nodes with star-shaped structures may indicate the use of mixers, where many transactions funnel into a single node, obscuring the original sources, aligning with privacy-focused trends in the market.
