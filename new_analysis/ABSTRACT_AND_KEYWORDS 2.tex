\begin{abstract}
Sampling strategies systematically bias LLM-generated insights in blockchain analysis. We design a modular multi-agent framework enabling researchers to define custom LLM-backed agents for graph analysis tasks. As a demonstration, we instantiate three agents to compare sampling methods on Bitcoin networks and introduce two metrics quantifying sampling-induced divergence. Experiments reveal substantial semantic drift: different sampling strategies discover distinct roles and yield different structure--text alignments. Our framework provides reusable infrastructure for systematic LLM experiments on graphs, with implications for social networks, knowledge graphs, and biological networks.

\begin{abstract}
Graph sampling strategies may systematically bias LLM-generated insights in blockchain analysis. We design a multi-agent framework to compare Random Walk with Fly-Back (RWFB) and Connectivity-Enhanced Transaction Sampling (CETraS) on Bitcoin's transaction network. Using three LLM agents (role classification, anomaly explanation, decentralization assessment), we introduce Semantic Drift Metric (SDM) and Consistency Index (CI) to quantify sampling-induced divergence. Experiments show substantial semantic drift: CETraS discovers specialized roles absent in RWFB, yet achieves better structure--text consistency. Our results demonstrate that sampling choice has measurable consequences for LLM-based network analysis, and our framework provides reproducible infrastructure for such experiments.
