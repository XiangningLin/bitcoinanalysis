The analyzed network exhibits a semi-centralized, multi-hub topology characterized by several influential nodes displaying balanced in-degree and out-degree without any single dominant hub. This structure includes multiple strongly and weakly connected components, indicating decentralized clusters rather than a giant connected core. Moderate betweenness centrality values reveal some bridge nodes that consolidate many incoming edges but have few outgoing edges, consistent with exchange or mixer behaviors aggregating deposits. Additionally, star-shaped outflow patterns from several nodes suggest payout batching typical of exchanges or mixers distributing funds. The presence of self-loop edges and repetitive transfers among a few addresses points to peeling chains or internal shuffling mechanisms used to obfuscate fund origins, enhancing privacy. Overall, the network combines small-world properties—such as moderate clustering and short path lengths—with redundancy across parallel hubs, fostering robustness, efficiency, and resilience against single-node failures while supporting decentralized fund flow and communication.
