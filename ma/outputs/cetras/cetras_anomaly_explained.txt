- Multiple nodes with very high in-degree but zero or near-zero out-degree (e.g., bc1qsg03rhpftdd8e5e0rn0c9ch0m43dkw5kequcde) suggest many-to-one consolidation, typical of exchanges aggregating user deposits or preparing for large withdrawals.

- Presence of nodes with high out-degree but low in-degree and self-loop edges (e.g., bc1qhmzw5arsdwnuhvcunrcua876p0c3juk0xsr7wm) indicates star-shaped fan-out patterns, consistent with payout batching or distribution from mixing services.

- Chains of nodes with moderate degrees and repetitive self-transfers (e.g., 36TZYLiYfpW4AU2vrvwNxTEUWez1YB9WHD and 3EX34GnTCYKLrGb7q5nc2obCXwnApvm3kJ) may represent peeling chains, a common mixer withdrawal pattern to obfuscate transaction trails.

These patterns align with October 2020 market trends where mixing services and exchange consolidations were prevalent due to increased regulatory scrutiny and privacy demands.
